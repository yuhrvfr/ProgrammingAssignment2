## Write a short comment describing this function
## The following function calculates the inverse of the matrix "matrix"
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if 
## the inverse of matrix has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse of matrix from the cache and skips 
## the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix 
## and sets the value of the inv in the cache via the setinv function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
}
